# AngularJS Project setup
1. **Node.js and npm**: Similar to setting up a React.js project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine, as it includes npm (Node Package Manager) by default. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. **Install AngularJS**: Once Node.js is installed, you can install AngularJS using npm in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install angular@1.x.x
   ```

   Replace `1.x.x` with the specific version of AngularJS you want to use (e.g., 1.8.2).

3. **Create the Project Structure**: AngularJS doesn't have an official CLI like modern Angular. Therefore, you need to create the project structure manually. Typically, you'll have an `index.html` file as the entry point of your application and a `js` folder to store your AngularJS components.

4. **Include AngularJS in HTML**: In your `index.html`, include the AngularJS library using a script tag:

   ```html
   <script src="node_modules/angular/angular.js"></script>
   ```

5. **Create AngularJS App Module**: In your `js` folder or a separate file, create the main AngularJS module and bootstrap your application:

   ```javascript
   // app.js or main.js
   angular.module('myApp', []);
   angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp']);
   ```

6. **Start Coding**: You can now start building your AngularJS application using controllers, directives, services, etc. Place these components in separate files within the `js` folder or organize them as you see fit.

7. **Use Directives and Data Binding**: AngularJS heavily relies on directives and two-way data binding to create dynamic user interfaces. Learn about built-in directives and how to create custom ones to manipulate the DOM.

8. **Testing (Optional)**: AngularJS supports testing with tools like Jasmine and Karma. You can write unit tests to ensure the quality of your code.

9. **Style and Design**: Add CSS styles or use a CSS framework like Bootstrap to enhance the look and feel of your application.

10. **Serve the Application**: For development purposes, you can use a simple HTTP server to serve your application. You can use `http-server`, `live-server`, or any other static file server.

That's a basic outline of how to set up an AngularJS project. Keep in mind that AngularJS is an older version of Angular and is no longer actively maintained by the Angular team. If you are starting a new project, it's recommended to consider using the latest version of Angular (Angular 2 and above) for better performance, modern features, and ongoing support.
